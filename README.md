# 📝 To-Do Task Tracker

**To-Do Task Tracker** is a full-stack web application built with **Flask** that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently.  
It includes core **CRUD functionality** — users can **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** tasks in a streamlined interface.  

The application also features:

- A **task-specific timer** to help users track focused work sessions.
- Integration with the **ZenQuotes API** to display a rotating set of motivational quotes.
- A visually embedded **“Study With Me” video player** for a distraction-free workflow environment.

Designed with a **mobile-first**, fully **responsive layout**, this project is suitable for both desktop and mobile use.  
The backend uses **SQLite** as a lightweight database solution, and the entire app is deployed using **Render** for public access.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Flask routing and templating
- Frontend styling using Bootstrap
- API integration
- Session handling and environment configuration
- Deployment of Python web apps
